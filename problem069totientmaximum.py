#Project Euler Problem 69 Totient Maximum
#Project Euler Problem 69ï¼š Totient Maximum [-L70Bpm6viU]
'''
Euler's totient function [sometimes called the phi function], is defined as the number of positive integers not exceeding n.  For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than or equal to nine and relatively prime to nine, phi(9)=6.  n=6 produces a maximum n/phi(n) for n is less than or equal to 10.  RM:  what's the definition of relatively prime?  It's the larger number which doesn't share any factors with the smaller number.

n   Relatively Prime   phi(n)  n/phi(n)
02  1                  1       2
03  1, 2               2       1.5
04  1, 3               2       2
05  1, 2, 3, 4         4       1.25
06  1, 5               2       3
07  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6   6       1.1666. . .
08  1, 3, 5, 7         4       2
09  1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8   6       1.5
10  1, 3, 7, 9         4       2.5

Find the value of n<=1,000,000 for which n/phi(n) is a maximum.
