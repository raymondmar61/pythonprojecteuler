It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

7 + 3
5 + 5
5 + 3 + 2
3 + 3 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?
'''
#function(n) f(n).  f(n) is the number of ways n can be represented as the sum of at least two primes.
#f(n,x) is the number of ways n can be represented as the sum of primes starting with x and x < n
#f(n) = f(n,2)+f(n,3)+f(n,5)+f(n,7) . . . +f(n,y) for which y is the largest prime smaller than n
#f(2) = 0
#f(3) = 0
#f(5) = 1

#f(n,2) = 1 if n is even.  0 if n is odd.
#f(n,3) = f(n-3,2)+f(n-3,3)

#f(n,x) = f(n-x,2)+f(n-x,3)+f(n-x,5)+ . . . + f(n-x,x) where n-x > x
#f(n,x) = f(n-x)+1 where n-x <= x
