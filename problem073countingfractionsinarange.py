Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.  RM:  HCF is Highest Common Factor.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d<=8 in ascending order of size, we get:  1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8.

It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2 which are 3/8, 2/5, and 3/7.

How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d<=12000?
